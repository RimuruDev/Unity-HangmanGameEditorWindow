A simple "Hangman" game developed for the Unity Editor. The player must guess the given word by choosing letters. The
player has a limited number of attempts to guess the word before the game ends.

## How to Play

- Launch the game in the Unity Editor.
- Several blank underscores will appear on the screen, representing the letters of the word to be guessed.
- Click on the letter buttons to guess the word.
- If you guess a letter correctly, it will appear in its correct position in the word.
- If the letter is not in the word, the remaining number of attempts will decrease.
- The game ends when you guess the word or when the attempts run out.
